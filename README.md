# DynamoFDW

A PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for accesing Amazon DynamoDB tables from within PostgreSQL.   Your application will interact with Dynamo using the standard SQL constructs of Postgres.   Under the covers, we plan to use the MultiCorn Python Adapter for accesing DynamoDB as a standard client securely and efficiently from withion the backend Postgres server process.

# Stay tuned!!
This is still a thought experiment, but, it should move quickly using the proven Multicorn framework.
